This is my solution to the Flight Booker project in The Odin Project.

The objective is to gain practice with advanced Ruby forms. The finished product will be an airline booking platform on which users can:

1. Enter desired dates / airports and click “Search”
2. Choose from among a list of eligible flights
3. Enter passenger information for all passengers
